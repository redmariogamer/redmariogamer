                <p>The game focuses on human characters from Seattle, Washington who were sucked into a vortex when travelling through a waterfall and were transformed into gingerbread cookies. Yikes! Along the way, you will meet a human talking golden retriever named Sunny who will guide you to make your way out of the world. Your main goal is explore the candy lands and defeat any enemies that get in your way by using the candy chompers Sunny provided you and the weapons you can collect from the shop. Collectives which are Pez Candy will be scattered around the world map and it would be used to exchange for upgrades and weapons. You start with just your trusty chomper and water gun to fight off swarms of candy monsters. As you move through each level, you’ll find new weapons and tools that help you better tackle future challenges. Once you finish the game, you get to play a new version called “new game plus,” which allows you to use all the tools you’ve earned to explore even more areas of the map that were previously locked.</p>
